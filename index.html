    <h1>Sound exploration demo for synthformer</h1>

    <p>I mainly explored trying to transition from one sound to another creatively.</p>

    <p>Here are my source samples chopped to 5 seconds, mono, 44100 Hz, 16 bit, wav files.</p>

    <p>Find the code original code for the DACSynthformer <a href="https://github.com/lonce/DACSynthformer">here</a>.</p>

    <h1>Experiment Results</h1>

    <h2>Small model (32 embed, 2000 epoch)</h2>
    <p>Model of size 32, trained for 2000 epochs. 
        We here some small bit of source material but mainly signature DAC codebook noise hearing voices that are not there.
        Note that we used only a limited subset of the source material in this example (mainly engine, boiling and drum break sounds), we can only fairly clearly hear the kettle boiling sound (at around 12 sec).

    <h2>Larger model (512 embed, 100 epoch). Getting stuck in certain sounds</h2>
    <p>We found that at early epoch iterations 50-100 epochs or so that even when we would use a conditionning pattern of to go from one class to another it would get stuck on the whistle sound. 
        Not neccessary to go quite this big for a small dataset model size of 256 also worked quite well.</p>

    <h2>Final result best "morph". (512 embed, 500 epochs)</h2>
    <p>The final result shows quite good representation of each of the source sounds and transitions between with some minimal noise.
        We had to increase the length of the output so that each of the sounds had a chance of getting in.
        The transitions are not as smooth as we would have liked and quite rapid despite our conditionning pattern.</p>

    <h2>Fun with breaks. Can I get an amennnn!!</h2>
    <p>Great for reinterpreting breaks. We should have tested with more.. got stuck for too long on kettles...</p>
